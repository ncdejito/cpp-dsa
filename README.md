# cpp-dsa

Personal solutions to Blind75 Data Structures and Algorithms exercises and test cases in C++

Benchmark Solutions: [Neetcode](https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode/tree/main/cpp)

## Goals
* Practice DSA
* Practice C++
* Create method for testing solutions on locked Leetcode problems
* Create extensible infrastructure for learning different languages later on

## Todo
* Add CMake unit testing
